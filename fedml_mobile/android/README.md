# OnDeviceTraining

This is the source of the android project used to the mobile on-device training of shallow neural networks and conventional ML models such as LR and SVM.

Note that this project is developed based on the [DL4JIrisClassifierDemo](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/tree/master/android/DL4JIrisClassifierDemo), you may need to refer to [http://deeplearning4j.org/](http://deeplearning4j.org/) for more information.



## How to run

The project is built using Android Studio, so the simplest way to run it is importing it to Android Studio and re-building it.

## Development Status
Stay tuned. We will release the tested code in 1-2 weeks.
